The relative frequencies are encoded by using the default two-color color ramp. The grey cells are bigrams that were not found in the corpus or were extremely rare. To find a particular bigram, trace down the heat map to find the row that corresponds to the first letter, then trace over until you reach the column of the second letter. Here are some observations about the relative frequencies of bigrams:
The vowels associate with almost all letters. Only the bigrams IY, UQ, and UW were not found in the corpus when a vowel is the first letter of a bigram. For bigrams that have a vowel as the second letter, only QA, QE, QI, and QO were not found in the corpus.
Vowels begin more than half of the most common bigrams.
The consonants N and R start many bigrams. All possible bigrams that begin with these consonants were found in the corpus. The consonants D and S are also frequently found at the beginning of a bigram. The consonants L, H, R, S, and T are often found as the second letter in a bigram. It surprised me that there are so many bigrams with H as the second letter. I can't think of many words that contain BH (abhor), DH (adhere), or HH (hitchhiker).
The letters J, Q, V, X, and Z have only a few friends that they hang out with. There are few bigrams that begin or end with those letters.
Some letters like to lead, other like to follow. The letter K is a leader: it begins bigrams frequently, but is less likely to follow another letter. In contrast, the letter F is happy follow other letters, but is reluctant to take the lead.
